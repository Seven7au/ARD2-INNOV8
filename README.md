# ARD2-INNOV8
Sample code for the Wiltronics ARD2-INNOV8 sheild for Arduino
The ARD2-INNOV8 shield is a piece of technology which has various outputs
and inputs, and sits on top of an Arduino Uno compatible micro-controller board
The ARD2-INNOV8 shield has been fitted with 7 LEDs (light emitting diodes), a
piezo buzzer, a bush button switch, a potentiometer, a light sensor, a temperature
sensor, a 6 volt input, and convenient snap in connectors to use with a wide range
of external modules such as servo motors, joystick module, and a real-time-clock
module.
The ARD2-INNOV8 shield was designed to take the headache out of learning
how to program a microcontroller like the Arduino Uno. It allows the user to
learn a wide range of Arduino lessons without the hassle of wiring up all of the
required components. The ARD2-INNOV8 shield helps make learning Arduino
programming easy, by allowing the user to concentrate on the programming
without being distracted by bugs in the circuit.
